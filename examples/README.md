# REST API - Examples
The game uses a simple REST-based API and passes data using JSON. Note that it is assumed
that ids used are UUIDs.
## Create user
Create User
When the game is started up the first (or reset) time it will create a new user. The
game expects this call to return a user id.  
**POST /user**  
**REQUEST EXAMPLE:**  
```json
{
"name": "John"
}
```
**RESPONSE EXAMPLE:**
```json
{
"id": "18dd75e9-3d4a-48e2-bafc-3c8f95a8f0d1",
"name": "John"
}
```

## Save Game State
Whenever a game is played it will try to save its game state using this request.  
**PUT /user/\<userid\>/state**  
**REQUEST EXAMPLE:**  
```json
{
"gamesPlayed": 42,
"score": 358
}
```

## Load Game State
On starting up the game it will load the game state. The score field should be considered
to be the player's highest score.  

**GET /user/\<userid\>/state**  
**RESPONSE EXAMPLE:**
```json
{
"gamesPlayed": 42,
"score": 358
}
```

## Update Friends
This request will only happen when the friend list actually changes. The request contains
the full list of friends.  
**PUT /user/\<userid\>/friends**  
**REQUEST EXAMPLE:** 
```json
{
"friends": 
  [
    "18dd75e9-3d4a-48e2-bafc-3c8f95a8f0d1",
    "f9a9af78-6681-4d7d-8ae7-fc41e7a24d08",
    "2d18862b-b9c3-40f5-803e-5e100a520249" 
  ]
}
```


## Get Friends
This request is called upon starting the game and must return the userâ€™s list of friends as
well as their high scores (the same score as listed in the game state) to allow populating the
high score table.  

**GET /user/\<userid\>/friends**  
**RESPONSE EXAMPLE:**  
```json
{
"friends": [
{
"id": "18dd75e9-3d4a-48e2-bafc-3c8f95a8f0d1",
"name": "John",
"highscore": 322
},
{
"id": "f9a9af78-6681-4d7d-8ae7-fc41e7a24d08",
"name": "Bob",
"highscore": 21
},
{
"id": "2d18862b-b9c3-40f5-803e-5e100a520249",
"name": "Alice",
"highscore": 99332
}
]
}
```


## Debug: Get All Users
Ok, so we didn't quite have time to figure out how people actually would get friends in
the game yet. So for now the game uses this request to get all users in the system so the
player can select who of these that he wants to be friends with.
Obviously, this will not scale at all; we will fix this later. For now, just implement it as is.
Feel free to improve this if you got time.  

**GET /user**  
**RESPONSE EXAMPLE:**  
```json
{
"users": [
{
"id": "18dd75e9-3d4a-48e2-bafc-3c8f95a8f0d1",
"name": "John"
},
{
"id": "f9a9af78-6681-4d7d-8ae7-fc41e7a24d08",
"name": "Bob"
},
{
"id": "2d18862b-b9c3-40f5-803e-5e100a520249",
"name": "Alice"
}
]
}
```
